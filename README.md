 Hello, I'm Omer. I am a frontend developer. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript. I am currently studying React Native.
 In addition, I hold bachelor's degrees in both Physiotherapy and History. I have previously worked as a physiotherapist and as a manager in a small food production workshop.
 I am now fully focused on software development. I aim to work in fields where creativity and teamwork are at the forefront. I highly value knowledge and experience sharing, and always strive to write the most functional, practical, and readable code.
 I am fluent in Turkish and Greek, and I have intermediate proficiency in English.
