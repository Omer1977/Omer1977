Hello, I'm Omer. I am a frontend developer candidate. I'm currently studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. 
I plan to learn ReactNative in the coming period. Apart from these, I have a bachelor's degree in both Physiotherapy and History. 
I previously worked as a physiotherapist and as a manager in a small food production workshop. 
I'm completely focused on software right now. I target business areas where creativity and teamwork are at the forefront. 
I speak fluent Turkish and Greek, as well as intermediate English.
